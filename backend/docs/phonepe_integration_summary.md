- `POST /api/webhooks/phonepe-webhook/` - Webhook handler

### Reconciliation System

- **Mandatory PhonePe schedule** implementation:
  - Every 3s for first 30s
  - Every 6s for next 60s
  - Every 10s for next 60s
  - Every 30s for next 60s
  - Every 1 minute thereafter
- **Management commands** for automated reconciliation
- **Cron job ready** for production deployment

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Payment Not Redirecting**: Check redirect URL configuration
2. **Status Not Updating**: Verify webhook configuration
3. **Reconciliation Failing**: Check management command execution
4. **Webhook Validation Failing**: Verify credentials and signature

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check payment status
python manage.py shell
>>> from core.models import Payment
>>> Payment.objects.filter(status='pending').count()

# Test PhonePe client
>>> from core.services.phonepe_service import PhonePeService
>>> client = PhonePeService.get_client()

# Run reconciliation
python manage.py reconcile_pending_payments --dry-run
```
